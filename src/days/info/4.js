  #### Daily UI #002 Challenge  
  
  > ♪ dollar dollar bill y'all ♫  
  
  ### Topics touched:
  - Tailwind.css
  - Vue Reactivity
  - Font Awesome
  
  ### What have I done?
  - Created a checkout form with cleave.js to format the inputs on the fly
  - Used Font Awesome for credit card icons and applied classes dynamically through tailwind.css
  
  ### What could be done better?
  - Form validation, especially since it is a payment form.
