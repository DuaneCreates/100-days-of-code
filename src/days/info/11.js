    I went through a bunch of newsletters I was subscribed to organize them. 
    I unsubscribed from some uninteresting ones, and also found new newsletters to subscribe to.  
    I think that newsletters are a great way to keep yourself updated, and to come by interesting stuff without you having to look for them!  
    There are many libraries or techniques which I have learned about through a newsletter, so for me they are definitely worth it.  
    Sometimes it is hard to keep up with all the emails if you are subscribed to a lot of them, so I suggest to only subscribe to a few good newsletters unless you love reading and have a lot of time on your hands.  
    However, having lots to read is better than having nothing to read, so get adventurous and subscribe to some newsletters!
