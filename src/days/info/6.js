  > ♪ Click a panel and it will grow; From greyscale to color, they will go ♫  

  ### Topics touched:
  - Flexbox
  - CSS Transitions
  
  ### What have I done?
  - I used flex to lay out full-height panels that grow once clicked
  - To achieve the full-height of the device's screen, I used height: 100vh
  - I used Vue to handle the click event and to assign dynamic classes based on the active panel
