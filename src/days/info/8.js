  I spent the weekend and today working on this website so that I can show all my progress in this challenge in an interactive manner.  
  So far I have always shown my creations as a video, to show how one can interact with it and how it reacts to different screen sizes.  
  However it is always better to give you the component and you can interact with it however you wish. I also add some of these results to Codepen but that has its limitations.   
  This website is in the form of a timeline and one can expand each day individually to view more information about it.  
  I have bought a Digital Ocean VPS with an Ubuntu distro, and have set up the LEMP stack on it.  
  This website was then deployed on such server.
