  > ♪ What's the time? Time for another CSS design! ♫  

  ### Topics touched:
  - JS Interval
  - CSS Transform
  
  ### What have I done?
  - I just created a clock face, with a simple border-radius
  - I placed the clock hands with an absolute position so I had to place it in the correct position using the top and left CSS properties
  - Some maths to calculate the hand's degrees, which I easily got from Wes
  - Hook the degrees styling and calculation with the Vue reactive variable which updates every second, and voila!
