  post: `
  I've been trying to create a project with AdonisJS, and unfortunately for me, I decided to use web sockets in this particular project idea. I didn't want to just learn another framework by building a boring CRUD app. I wanted to create something bigger and more interesting, however Adonis web sockets are giving me lots of trouble to work with Vue.js and I can't find very good help online. That's not my biggest disappointment, it's just that I am wasting lots of time being stuck, and not working on my daily challenges. Therefore, for now I will be putting this project at a lower priority as I don't want to stay stuck on it.
