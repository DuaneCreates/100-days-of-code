  #### JS 30 #001 Challenge  
  
  > ♪ Wes can hum, Wes can drum, All this drumming, my thumb is numb ♫  

  ### Topics touched:
  - Vue Lifecycle
  - Keydown Event Listener
  - CSS Transition
  - HTML5 Audio
  
  ### What have I done?
  - I placed the HTML5 audio tags linking to an audio file, each having a unique ref 
  - Then I created an event listener for a keydown
  - Got the audio associated with the key by using the Vue ref 
  - Just play the audio and put some animation on them buttons to make them dance
