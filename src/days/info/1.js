  #### Daily UI #001 Challenge  
  
  > ♪ One sign up here, one sign up there, why do I have to create an account everywhere? ♫  
  
  Thanks to unDraw for the illustration  
  
  ### Topics touched:
  - Tailwind.css
  - Vue Reactivity
  
  ### What have I done?
  - Created a fictional scenario based on the first interesting illustration I found on unDraw (turns out to be Ninja, a gamer which I don't follow, but oh well, apparently he's throwing a private party, and you're invited)
  - Created a sign-up form like I have never done before

  ### What could be done better?
  - Input Validation, of course, it just checks for a minimum of 5 chars
  - Maybe better color palette? But I wanted to use the illustration's hair color, eye-blowing green.
  - The input green, indicating a valid input, should be more blended
