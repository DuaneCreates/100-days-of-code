  Thanks to unDraw for the illustration  
  
  ### Topics touched:
  - Tailwind.css
  - Vue Reactivity
  
  ### What have I done?
  - Created a fictional scenario based on the first interesting illustration I found on unDraw (turns out to be Ninja, a gamer which I don't follow, but oh well, apparently he's throwing a private party, and you're invited)
  - Created a form like I have never done before, using different states such as the normal state, the active state, and the valid state, which apparently only needs to have 1 single char to be valid

  ### What could be done better?
  - Input Validation, of course
  - Maybe better color palette? But I wanted to use the illustration's hair color
  - The input green, indicating a valid input, should be more blended, it seems to be attracting too much information, as if it should've been used to note an active input field instead of a valid one
