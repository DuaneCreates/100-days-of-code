  Today I research about why Node.js is trending and if what it offers is right for me.
  I am still unsure if I should switch from PHP to Node.js but I still have lots to learn about it before I can make a decision.
  Since I am a big fan of Laravel, it won't be easy to be convinced to switch. Plus, I need to see more about the frameworks available for Node.js and if they can match what a framework like Laravel offers.
