  I was looking at day 13 from JS30, which focuses on animating in elements on scroll but I didn't like how dirty it is to just do a simple animation on scroll.  
  I looked at some libraries which already do this in a clean and fast way, and found a very popular library called Animate on Scroll (AOS).  
  I tried it and it is very easy to hook up and use. They even have a few options to customize your app.
