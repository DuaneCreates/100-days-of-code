  #### Daily UI #006 Challenge  
   
  ### Topics touched:
  - Tailwind.css
  - CSS Transitions
  - CSS Media Queries
  
  ### What have I done?
  - I created a simple form with a normal cover and profile picture layout  
  - I used some illustrations from unDraw
  - The layout was based on flexbox
  - I applied a CSS transition on every element so that they transition from their mobile to their desktop state smoothly

  ### What could be done better?
  - Input Validation
  - Color Palette
  - Mobile Avatar
  - Functionality
