  post: `
  I've been looking into a bunch of Node.js frameworks lately. I've watched a few crash-courses for some, and even tried a few of them in a mini-project scenario. Some of the most interesting ones for me were Express.js, Nest.js and AdonisJS.  
  My favourite so far is AdonisJS, which I plan to be using for further testing and experimentation in the coming days. I might even create a real, but small, project with it, because I think that's the best way to use a framework.  
  The reason why I seem to prefer AdonisJS is mostly because I come from a Laravel framework background, which is the framework that AdonisJS is inspired from. This would make it much easier for me to learn than something like Nest.js, which seems to take after Angular a lot, which is not something I am fond of. The community behind AdonisJS also seems to be growing rapidly, and even as a framework, it has been getting a lot of traction lately, being featured on a bunch of articles such as Scotch.io.  
  I will let you know how I am progressing with AdonisJS in the coming days, although I cannot share much about the project, I will try to still share about my experience working with such a framework.
