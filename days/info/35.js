  I have tried Strapi, using their [Quick Start Guide](https://strapi.io/documentation/3.x.x/getting-started/quick-start.html) and I am amazed by how simple it is to get up and running with a full-fledged CMS and a ready-made API.  
  By default the API uses REST but with a 10 seconds installation and configuration you can get it running with GraphQL too.  
  You can manage roles for CRUD operations on the API, and even create custom models. The database will be modified automatically so you only need to use their admin panel.
  It is a 100% free solution and open-source, so there's nothing to lose if you want to try it out.
