  title: 'Game Development is not a one-man thing',
  post: `
  I was thinking of starting a game in the past few days, and although I had some nice ideas for an original piece, I realized after some prototypes that creating a game alone would take so much time which I don't feel ready to spare.  
  There's also the problem that usually, a person is not good at all aspects of game development. In my case, the artistic side is lacking as I found it hard to create characters. I tried both 3D and 2D and figured that the best approach would be to team up with an artist.  
  Teaming up would make everything serious and I'm not ready to do that right now as I want to explore different things and learn more about web development to better equip myself in my main objectives.  
  This means that for now I will be putting game development on the side and approach it again later on in the future when I can dedicate more time and general commitments to it.
