  title: 'Node.js Frameworks - Spoilt for choice',
  post: `
  Last time I started to research about Node.js and try some basic examples using its raw form.  
  Today I tried Express.js, and although it seems very light and fast, I want a framework that does more right off the bat. I come from the Laravel framework mindset, so I was hoping for something similar for Node.js.  
  Turns out, that there exists a framework called Adonis, which is built on the principles of Laravel, but I still need to look into it more to see whether it is lacking behind, or more advanced, when compared to Laravel.  
  It seems like theere are other good alternatives as well, some mature choices such as Sails.js and Meteor, and some other lesser known ones such as Feathers.js.  
  I will need to try more than one of them, because there are many to choose from, which makes it harder to choose!
