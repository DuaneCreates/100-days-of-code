  It's not as easy as I thought to convert a working website from a Vue.js SPA to Nuxt. It would be much better to start a project from scratch with Nuxt if you know that you will be going to that direction. 
  It is not impossible to do so, it is just more work. I've been doing progress and I will get it finished soon. 
  You have to change the ways to import libraries, and you have to cater for DOM manipulations so that they don't execute on the server side, since the server cannot access the DOM.
