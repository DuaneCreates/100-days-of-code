  I loaded up a project I worked on a long time ago and took some parts of it. I continued experimenting with the physics engine, so I made a quick 3D model of a track and put some balls on it. I added some spots that will give a speed boost so that the balls collide fast with each other and show a 'Kapow!' message. I think it is pretty cool how simple this is to do.
