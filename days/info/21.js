  post: `
  I'm currently half-way through the challenge! I learned a lot of different JavaScript techniques so far. I didn't do a challenge for most of these lessons, since they were not very visual, but it is still progress.
  I've learned about some cool functions and techniques like destructuring assignments. I bet there's much more awesome stuff to see!
