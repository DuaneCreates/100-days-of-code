  ### Topics touched:
  - Canvas
  - ES6 Destructuring
  - HSL
  
  ### What have I done?
  - I have simply created an HTML canvas, and hooked mouse events to toggle between painting mode and to actually draw something when the mouse is clicked
  - I used HSL which makes it simple to go from one color to another by simply changing one value, the hue, which is constantly being incremented while holding the mouse down
