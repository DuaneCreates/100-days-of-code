  I did some experimenting with particle systems. Games are much better when there is visual ques to help you understand what is happening. An example of this is when a bullet hits a wall, there's a particle that shows dust, or a spark.  
  Creating a particle is more artistic than programmatic, so I used some programming with Unity's classes to programmatically spawn and start particles, depending on data such as; what the speed of the collision was; what type of object was hit, and anything else that comes to mind to make it seem more realistic.
