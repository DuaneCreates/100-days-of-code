  post: `
  As I am a coder at heart, when I used to have a vision for a piece of UI, I would get straight to coding it.  
  Lately I've been hearing a lot about [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/mt/products/xd.html), which is a free tool by Adobe to design and prototype user interfaces. I decided to try it out and I liked it! This changed me, as then when I had visions of user interfaces I went straight to designing it in Adobe XD instead. This made me much more creative as I was not limited by code, and dragging and placing components around with a snapping tool makes everything easier to come up with cool designs.  
  It's always good to keep learning and trying out new things and approaches to keep evolving yourself.
