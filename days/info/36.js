  title: 'Tailwind 1.0 Released!',
  post: `
  Tailwind CSS has been gaining traction lately as a utility-first CSS framework that helps you build designs from scratch faster.  
  Now that version 1.0 has been released, it is even better to configure than before as the configuration file is simpler.  
  Their documentation and release notes explains everything you need to know.  So the only thing left to do is to check out their [Get Started Guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/) and see what you think for yourself.
