  title: 'First Major Freelance Project - Done!',
  post: `
  I just managed to finish my first major freelance project which has been going for months.  
  It was based on [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) (PHP Framework) and I used [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/) because back then I didn't create my own designs.  
  I learned a lot about Laravel from this project, and I also learned about limitations that can arise when using a UI component library. This led me to start practising creating websites from scratch, which was more of a confidence issue than a skill issue before. Once you get your feet wet and start learning, it will all get better with time and work!
