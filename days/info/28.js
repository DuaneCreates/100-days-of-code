  Flexbox is awesome, probably my favourite part of CSS. It is not hard to understand, it just needs a little effort at first. Once you get the hang of it, you'll be able to place things where you want and lay elements as you imagine.  
  If you want to create layouts with code, or work in front-end, I really suggest you check it out. It does not need a library, as it comes with normal CSS and is supported by all the major web browsers.
